# Panda3D

Did you know that penguins are warm-blooded?

My friends Krishangi Deka and Hinal Patel helped me create a 3D animated world using #python and #panda3d. In this world, Panda Chan needs to find his best friend Penguin Cool and bring him home during a blizzard.

In the game, the penguin is placed at random places throughout the environment and the computer needs to direct Panda Chan to his location using basic #machinelearning.

Let me know if you have experimented with Panda3D or #blender3d in any of your #videogames projects! And let us know if we can walk you through the code on our github accounts. Thanks!

I think Panda Chan was invented by the Panda3D folks, so good job.  A lot of the models were borrowed or tweaked from the Panda3D tutorial.  These are all weekend projects for fun.
